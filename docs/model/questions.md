# Questions

1. Currently the event id is generated by the Monty system as a [uuid](https://github.com/IFRCGo/GCDB/blob/e077a4d22eea1c89ddbd3787ab3ae5b6ba1fad6b/RCode/GCDB_Objects/MontyMethods.R#L35) with no semantic meaning but the [some code ](https://github.com/IFRCGo/Monty-IFRC/blob/main/API/helpers/DREF_forecasting.R#L13) and schema suggest that it should be a string with a specific naming including elements like the country code, the event type and the date. Should we keep the current implementation or change it to a more meaningful string?
2. Event location is recommanded to be a simple point as it is better for initial instersection search. It is also better for clustering and display on the map.  More geometries can be used for the hazard, impact and response data to represent the affected area. Is that assumption correct?
