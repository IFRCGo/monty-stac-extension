In February 2023, two severe earthquakes struck Syria and Turkey in quick succession, followed by two more powerful earthquakes and over a hundred aftershocks in the subsequent weeks. This disaster resulted in over 48,000 fatalities, with many people still missing. Similarly, in June 2022, Afghanistan was hit by an earthquake while already grappling with a multi-year drought, which was then followed by extreme rainfall and flooding in August. Pakistan also faced a series of unfortunate events throughout 2022. After a period of drought, a heatwave-induced glacier melt combined with a heavy rain season led to devastating flooding, landslides, and disease outbreaks. Additionally, the country contended with severe wildfires in May and June 2022.</p> <p>The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction defines such complex events as multi-hazard events involving the simultaneous or sequential occurrence of two or more hazards and their potentially interrelated impacts. For example, the flash floods in Pakistan were likely exacerbated by the wildfires in other regions. Due to connections and feedback between multiple events, the combined impact of a multi-hazard event can be different from the sum of the impacts of multiple individual disasters.</p> <p>This requires a shift from a fragmented to a more comprehensive approach to disaster reporting, including more frequent and consistent use of multi-risk terminology and adopting a broader definition of multi-hazard events. Improved recognition of multi-hazard events in disaster reporting will provide a more accurate representation of such complex disasters and their impacts, enhancing public awareness and understanding of multi-hazard events. Additionally, more attention to interconnected natural hazards in the reporting of official disaster data can support disaster risk science and management efforts.</p> <p>Monty is a system that aims to address this challenge by providing a comprehensive and consistent approach to disaster data collection, management, and reporting. As such, the model used by Monty is designed to support the identification and tracking events, hazards, impacts, and responses from various sources. Its model must be flexible enough to cope with the heterogeneity of the data sources and the different representations of the disaster data.</p>"},{"location":"model/correlation_identifier/#monty-approach-correlation-identifier","title":"Monty Approach: correlation identifier","text":"<p>The Monty system uses a correlation identifier to link the items in the system.

relationships between hazards</li> </ul> <p>Key Changes: - Multiple hazards merged (e.g., all tsunami types consolidated into MH0705) - Hazards reclassified across types (e.g., Polluted Air moved to Environmental from Meteorological) - New open coding system allows future additions within clusters - Enhanced monitoring and multi-hazard context sections</p> <p>The 8 Hazard Types and 39
