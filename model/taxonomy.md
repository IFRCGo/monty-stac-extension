### [EM-DAT CRED Classification Tree](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-structure-and-content/disaster-classification-system/#main-classification-tree)

Note: In September 2023, the EM-DAT Classification Tree was updated and simplified to facilitate user queries and filtering. The current tree is based on four depth levels (group, subgroup, type, subtype), replacing the former tree with three plus two optional depth levels. The 'Complex' disaster group was removed.
